# CTC-New-Hire-Salary-Prediction
This project aims to predict the compensation package (CTC) of employees using a machine learning model. The model utilizes various features such as education, experience, previous CTC, and other relevant factors to provide an estimate of the expected CTC for an employee.
## Project Overview
The CTC Prediction ML Project utilizes supervised machine learning techniques to train a predictive model. The model is trained on a dataset containing historical information about employees, including their education, experience, previous CTC, and other relevant attributes. By analyzing this data, the model learns patterns and relationships to make predictions about the expected CTC for new employees.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is not included in the repository. However, you can obtain a similar dataset or use your own dataset with similar features for training the model. The dataset should be in a structured format, such as a CSV file, with each row representing a data sample and each column representing a feature.

The dataset should include the following features:

Education: The level of education of the employee.

Experience: The number of years of work experience of the employee.

Previous CTC: The compensation package (CTC) of the employee's previous job.

Other relevant features: Additional features that may influence the CTC prediction.
## Tools Used:
Excel for basic understanding of the dataset.

MySql for answering some questions related to the dataset to reveal some insights from it.

Python for Exploratory data analysis and Machine Learning.
